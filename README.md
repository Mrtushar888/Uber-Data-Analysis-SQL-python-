# Uber-Data-Analysis-SQL-python-
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing Uber trip data. The data is initially stored in an Excel file and then imported into a SQL database (uber_database). Various SQL queries are performed to derive meaningful insights from the data, which are then visualized using Power BI.


# Data
The data used in this project consists of trip details and other relevant information about Uber trips. The dataset includes the following tables:

trip_details: Contains detailed information about each trip.
trips: Contains information about trips including driver IDs, fare, distance, and duration.
payment: Contains payment methods.
assembly: Contains location information.

# Setup
Database Setup
1) Create Database: Create a database named uber_database.
2) Import CSV Files: Import the CSV files into the respective tables in the uber_database.

# SQL Queries
Various SQL queries are executed to analyze the data. Below are some of the key queries performed:

1) Total trips
2) Total drivers
3) Total earnings
4) Total completed trips
5) Total searches
6) Average distance per trip
7) Most used payment method
8) Top 5 earning drivers
9) Conversion rate
10) And More

# Power BI Visualization
After performing the SQL analysis, the data is connected to Power BI for visualization. Various dashboards are created to visualize the key metrics and insights derived from the data, such as:

Total trips and earnings
Driver and customer statistics
Trip durations and distances
Payment methods
Cancellation rates
Conversion rates

# Results
The visualizations in Power BI provide a comprehensive overview of the Uber trip data, highlighting important metrics and trends. This helps in understanding the performance and patterns in the Uber trips, enabling data-driven decision making.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of importing data into a SQL database, performing detailed analysis using SQL queries, and visualizing the results using Power BI. The insights derived from this project can be used to improve operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize overall performance.
