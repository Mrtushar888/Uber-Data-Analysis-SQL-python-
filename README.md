# Uber-Data-Analysis-SQL-python-
In this project, I analyzed Uber trip data using SQL and Power BI to extract and visualize key insights. Using SQL, I queried the dataset to gather metrics such as trip duration, distance, and fare details. I then used Power BI to create interactive dashboards, highlighting peak usage times, popular routes, and cost factors.
